CryptoSystem
============
Encrypt uses transportation and substituion. 
Decrypt is used to decipher the cipher from encrypt. So uses similar but opposite approach to encrypt.

   YOU CAN MODIFY HOW SUBSTITUION OR TRANSPOSITION IS DONE TO MAKE DECRYPTION WORK. BUT GENERAL STRUCTURE SHOULD
   BE THE SAME.
   
Need to be done:

 1) Make encrypt take user given file instead of hard coded file -- like right now.
 2) Decrypt is not functional. It just has its skeleton. So, look at how encrypt works nd do the reverse -- by implementing the
    given functions -- Need to spend time for this one. So one needs to be ready to spend more time to be commited for this one. 
 3) Apply the same approach to decryp to decipher user given file.




Select from the options above to work on. And let us know which one you are commited to.
